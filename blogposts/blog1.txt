Blog Post
Today I am starting my winter break project between semesters. We ( well thats just me actually ) post about web scraping the Star Trek Continuing Comittee, to get the elements of what make the cards they have created to start. This will probably be done with python using BeautifulSoup as I learn it. Then, after we get this information, we will create a database ( also to be on github ) to make our own API to retrieve it. Finally, we will use Javascript to use the API and create a webpage that users can browse the card list dynamically but also maybe add some functionality with card collecting.

Blog Post
Second update today. Added in basic bootstrap to this blog. Now onto python. May post excerpts from my code, which will mean I will need to update this blog script for quote blocks... later.
